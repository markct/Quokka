Quokka is an alternative way to track time on "Assembla":http://www.assembla.com.

To use it, put it somewhere in your web root, then:
# Copy .htaccess-example to .htaccess and edit it.
# Copy app/config-example.php to app/config.php and edit it.

Current to-do list:
# Show only time entries for the past 2 weeks; waiting on response to "this support ticket":https://www.assembla.com/spaces/AssemblaSupport/support/tickets/1838
# Encrypt user/pass in session storage
# When ticket isn't loaded, show "old ticket" instead of "no ticket", or fetch it
# Time zone awareness
# Improve aesthetics
# Show proper error messages for login and time entry save failures
# Turn tickets dropdown into an autocomplete combo
